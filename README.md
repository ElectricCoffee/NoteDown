# Motivation

Let's face it: taking notes in Markdown sucks when you study in any sort of mathematics-related field; 
be it mathematics, computer science, physics etc.

While Markdown works well for general note-taking due to its minimalist syntax, 
it absolutely sucks when it comes to inputting formul√¶.

To solve this, I propose NoteDown: Markdown with a set of convenient extensions that makes it usable for technical note-taking.

Features:
* LaTeX-like equation editing
* Syntax highlighting for code
* Tables
* All the usual good stuff found in regular Markdown

# Note
The system is (obviously) still under development, but you're free to help out!
